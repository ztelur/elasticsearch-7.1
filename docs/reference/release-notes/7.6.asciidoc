[[known-issues-7.6.0]]
[discrete]
=== Known issues

* Applying deletes or updates on an index after it has been shrunk may corrupt
the index. In order to prevent this issue, it is recommended to stop shrinking
read-write indices. For read-only indices, it is recommended to force-merge
indices after shrinking, which significantly reduces the likeliness of this
corruption in the case that deletes/updates would be applied by mistake. This
bug is fixed in {es} 7.7 and later versions. More details can be found on the
https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LUCENE-9300[corresponding issue].

* Indices created in 6.x with <<date,`date`>> and <<date_nanos,`date_nanos`>> fields using formats
that are incompatible with java.time patterns will cause parsing errors, incorrect date calculations or wrong search results.
https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/pull/52555
This is fixed in {es} 7.7 and later versions.

* Slow loggers can cause Log4j loggers to leak over time. When a new index is created,
 a new Log4j logger is associated with it. However, when an index is deleted,
  Log4j keeps an internal reference to its loggers that results in a memory leak (issue: {es-issue}56171[#56171])
+
This issue is fixed in {es} 6.8.10 and 7.7.1.

* Week-based date patterns are not working correctly with `Y`. Using `Y` with `w` will result in
a failed request and an exception in the logs (issue: {es-issue}57128[#57128]). Using `y` with `w` results in
incorrect date calculations. A workaround is to add the following line to the `jvm.options` file.
+
[source,shell]
--------------------------------------------
9-:-Djava.locale.providers=SPI,COMPAT
--------------------------------------------

This issue is fixed in {es} 7.7.0 and later versions (issue: {es-issue}50916[#50916]).
