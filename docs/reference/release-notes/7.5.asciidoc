[[known-issues-7.5.0]]
[discrete]
=== Known issues

* Applying deletes or updates on an index after it has been shrunk may corrupt
the index. In order to prevent this issue, it is recommended to stop shrinking
read-write indices. For read-only indices, it is recommended to force-merge
indices after shrinking, which significantly reduces the likeliness of this
corruption in the case that deletes/updates would be applied by mistake. This
bug is fixed in {es} 7.7 and later versions. More details can be found on the
https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LUCENE-9300[corresponding issue].

* Stop all {transforms} during a rolling upgrade to 7.5.
If a {transform} is running during upgrade, the {transform} audit index might disappear.
(issue: {es-issue}/49730[#49730])

* Indices created in 6.x with <<date,`date`>> and <<date_nanos,`date_nanos`>> fields using formats
that are incompatible with java.time patterns will cause parsing errors, incorrect date calculations or wrong search results.
https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/pull/52555
This is fixed in {es} 7.7 and later versions.
